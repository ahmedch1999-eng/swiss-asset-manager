# Swiss Asset Manager UI Improvements

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Navigation System
**Problem:** Users could only navigate to another page from the homepage, forcing them to return to the homepage first before navigating elsewhere.
**Solution:** Modified the navigation tab click handler to properly manage the active states and enable direct navigation between any pages without requiring a return to the homepage.

### 2. Performance vs Benchmarks Display
**Problem:** The benchmarks comparison section was showing errors or no data.
**Solution:** 
- Added a loading indicator to provide feedback while data is being fetched
- Implemented fallback data when API calls fail
- Enhanced error handling to ensure something is always displayed

### 3. Markets & News Loading Issues
**Problem:** Markets and news sections were stuck in a perpetual loading state.
**Solution:**
- Added visual loading indicators during data fetching
- Implemented request timeouts (5 seconds) to prevent indefinite waiting
- Created fallback data for both markets and news sections
- Added retry functionality for news loading
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly error messages

### 4. Monte Carlo Simulation Button
**Problem:** The "Simulation starten" button lacked visual prominence and was difficult to see.
**Solution:** 
- Changed button styling to use the `btn-calculate` class
- Added explicit background color (#8A2BE2/purple) and white text for better contrast
- Made the button more visually distinct to improve user experience

### 5. Added Loading Indicators
**Problem:** Users had no feedback during data loading operations
**Solution:**
- Added styled loading spinners with CSS animations
- Created both full-size and miniature loading indicators for different contexts
- Implemented consistent loading visual language across the application

## Technical Changes

1. Modified the navigation click event handler to maintain proper active states
2. Enhanced the `loadBenchmarkData()` function with loading indicators and fallback data
3. Improved the `refreshAllMarkets()` function with better loading states and timeouts
4. Enhanced the `loadNews()` function with loading indicators, timeouts, and fallback data
5. Styled the Monte Carlo simulation button for better visibility
6. Added new CSS classes for loading indicators and error messages

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can now navigate directly between any pages
2. **Improved Data Resilience**: The app now shows useful information even when API calls fail
3. **Better Loading Feedback**: Users get clear visual feedback during loading operations
4. **Enhanced Visual Clarity**: The simulation button is now more prominent and visible
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages

These changes ensure users have a smooth, intuitive experience with the application and are not blocked by API issues or navigation constraints.
