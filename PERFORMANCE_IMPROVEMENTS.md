# Performance Optimization for Swiss Asset Manager

This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to fix the slow loading times of the Swiss Asset Manager application.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Implemented aggressive caching to minimize external API calls to Yahoo Finance and other data providers
2. **Deferred Non-Essential Loading**: Added a loading queue system to prioritize critical data
3. **Enhanced Caching**: Applied multiple levels of caching (in-memory, disk, and HTTP response caching)
4. **Improved User Experience**: Added a loading indicator and reduced visual complexity during initial load
5. **Request Limiting**: Implemented controls to prevent too many concurrent API requests
6. **Error Resilience**: Added fallback mechanisms when API calls fail

## Implementation Details

### 1. First Implementation: Cache Enhancements
- Added `cache_enhancements_fix.py` to implement aggressive initial caching
- Modified cache system to accept stale data on initial page load
- Implemented memory monitoring to prevent cache-related memory issues

### 2. Front-end Optimizations
- Created `performance.js` to manage loading queue and limit concurrent API requests
- Added clear loading indicator with status updates
- Reduced animation complexity during page load with performance mode
- Deferred loading of non-essential JavaScript resources

### 3. API Response Caching
- Added `@cached_response` decorator to Flask routes to prevent redundant processing
- Implemented different TTL (Time To Live) values for different types of data:
  - Market data: 30-60 seconds
  - News: 5 minutes
  - Portfolio data: 10 minutes
  - Bank portfolios: 10 minutes

### 4. Second Implementation: Quick Performance Fix
- Added `quick_performance_fix.py` as a non-invasive enhancement solution
- Implemented function patching to add caching without modifying original files
- Created enhanced frontend optimization with `quick-performance.js`
- Added robust request tracking and management:
  - Limited concurrent API requests to 3
  - Added request timeouts (5 seconds)
  - Enhanced loading indicators with real-time status updates
  - Implemented fallback to cached data when request limits are reached

### 5. Optimized Initial Data Load
- Added aggressive cache usage for initial page load
- Implemented fallback to stale data when fresh data is not immediately available
- Added pre-loading of critical cache files from disk
- Reduced animation complexity for better initial rendering performance

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Optimizations
```python
# In-memory caching system with request limiting
API_CACHE = {}
API_CACHE_LOCK = threading.RLock()
CACHE_TTL = {
    'default': 300,        # 5 minutes
    'market_data': 60,     # 1 minute
    'news': 300,           # 5 minutes
    'benchmarks': 300,     # 5 minutes
}

MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 3
ACTIVE_REQUESTS = 0
REQUEST_LOCK = threading.RLock()

def cache_api_response(ttl_category='default'):
    """Decorator for caching API responses"""
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Generate cache key
            key = f"{func.__name__}:{str(args)}:{str(kwargs)}"
            
            # Check cache first
            with API_CACHE_LOCK:
                if key in API_CACHE:
                    timestamp, value = API_CACHE[key]
                    ttl = CACHE_TTL.get(ttl_category, CACHE_TTL['default'])
                    if time.time() - timestamp < ttl:
                        return value
            
            # Handle API request limiting
            global ACTIVE_REQUESTS
            with REQUEST_LOCK:
                if ACTIVE_REQUESTS >= MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS:
                    with API_CACHE_LOCK:
                        if key in API_CACHE:
                            return API_CACHE[key][1]
                ACTIVE_REQUESTS += 1
            
            try:
                # Call original function
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                # Cache the result
                with API_CACHE_LOCK:
                    API_CACHE[key] = (time.time(), result)
                return result
            finally:
                with REQUEST_LOCK:
                    ACTIVE_REQUESTS -= 1
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

### Frontend Optimizations
```javascript
// Manage concurrent requests and loading state
const originalFetch = window.fetch;
window.fetch = function(url, options) {
    // Check if this is an API request
    const isApiRequest = typeof url === 'string' && (
        url.includes('/get_') || 
        url.includes('/update_') || 
        url.includes('/refresh_')
    );
    
    // For non-API requests, use original fetch
    if (!isApiRequest) {
        return originalFetch(url, options);
    }
    
    // For API requests, manage loading state
    pendingRequests++;
    
    // Show loading indicator if needed
    if (pendingRequests === 1 && !initialLoadComplete) {
        showLoadingIndicator();
    }
    
    // Add timeout to the request
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT);
    
    // Make the request
    return originalFetch(url, fetchOptions)
        .then(response => {
            clearTimeout(timeoutId);
            pendingRequests--;
            
            // Update loading status
            if (pendingRequests === 0) {
                hideLoadingIndicator();
            }
            
            return response;
        })
        .catch(error => {
            clearTimeout(timeoutId);
            pendingRequests--;
            
            // Handle errors gracefully
            console.error(`Error fetching ${url}:`, error);
            throw error;
        });
};
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: Consider implementing server-side rendering for initial content
2. **Progressive Data Loading**: Implement more granular data loading based on visible sections
3. **Compression**: Add response compression for API endpoints
4. **Database Caching**: Consider a proper database for caching instead of files (e.g., Redis)
5. **Service Worker**: Implement a full service worker for offline functionality
6. **HTTP/2**: Upgrade to HTTP/2 for multiplexed connections

## Performance Impact

- Initial page load time has been significantly reduced
- API calls are now better managed and queued
- The application provides better feedback during loading processes
- The system gracefully degrades under poor network conditions by using cached data
- Animations are reduced during high-load periods for better performance

These optimizations ensure a much better user experience while maintaining all functionality without changing the content of the application.
